Objective

if and else are two of the most frequently used conditionals in C/C++, and they enable you to execute zero or one conditional statement among many such dependent conditional statements. We use them in the following ways:

    if: This executes the body of bracketed code starting with 

if

evaluates to true.

if (condition) {
    statement1;
    ...
}

if - else: This executes the body of bracketed code starting with
if evaluates to true, or it executes the body of code starting with if

evaluates to false. Note that only one of the bracketed code sections will ever be executed.

if (condition) {
    statement1;
    ...
}
else {
    statement2;
    ...
}

if - else if - else: In this structure, dependent statements are chained together and the
for each statement is only checked if all prior conditions in the chain are evaluated to false. Once a evaluates to true, the bracketed code associated with that statement is executed and the program then skips to the end of the chain of statements and continues executing. If each

    in the chain evaluates to false, then the body of bracketed code in the else block at the end is executed.

    if(first condition) {
        ...
    }
    else if(second condition) {
        ...
    }
    .
    .
    .
    else if((n-1)'th condition) {
        ....
    }
    else {
        ...
    }
