struct is a way to combine multiple fields to represent a composite data structure. For example, we can store details related to a student in a struct consisting of his age (int), first_name (string), last_name (string) and standard (int). You have to create a struct, named Student, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student.

Input Format

Input will consist of four lines. The first line will contain an integer, representing age. The second line will contain a string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the first_name of a student. The third line will contain another string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the last_name of a student. The fourth line will contain an integer, representing the standard of student.

Constraints

The number of characters in first_name and last_name will not exceed 50.

Output Format

Output will be of a single line, consisting of age, first_name, last_name and standard, each separated by one white space.
